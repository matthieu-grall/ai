# Methodological tools for artificial intelligence (AI)

This project aims to **provide methodological tools for managing AI-related risks**.

A presentation is provided in [.pdf](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20Pr%C3%A9sentation.pdf) and [.pptx](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20Pr%C3%A9sentation.pptx) formats.

It **comprises a set of documents**, developed collaboratively and under continuous improvement:
1. [risk management method](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20M%C3%A9thode.md);
2. [trust criteria](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20Crit%C3%A8res%20de%20confiance.md);
3. [best practices](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20Bonnes%20pratiques.md);
4. [usecases and functionalities](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20Cas%20d'usages.md);
5. [reference documents](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20Documents%20de%20r%C3%A9f%C3%A9rence.md).

It is **intended to fit in with existing approaches within organizations**, notably system certification processes. However, some or all of these documents may also be used directly, together or separately.

The **backlog** is currently the following (using MoSCoW priorization: (M) Must have | (S) Should have | (C) Could Have | (W) Won't have):
| <center>**Documents**</center> | <center>**Added value**</center> | <center>**Limits**</center> | <center>**Actions on documents**</center> | <center>**Actions on references**</center> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| General | Global approach, needed by organizations | - Institutions are not legitimate on a wide global scope</br>- [RÃ¨glement IA] scope is ambiguous and might be diverted</br>- Currently only in French | - (S) Promote the problematic and the approach</br>- (S) Translate into English | None for now |
| Risk management method | 1. Huge: simple, pragmatic, global, flexible | - May appear as focused on EBIOS only | - **(M) Add a reference to [ISO/IEC 27090] for attacks and controls**</br>- (S) Try to describe the method using [ISO 31000] and/or [ISO/IEC 27005]</br>- (C) Better explain that the starting tools are existings ones | - (S) Contribute to the reference documents (e.g. [ISO/IEC 23894], [ISO/IEC 42001], EU draft on risk management, [Guide de France IA]) when created or revised |
| Best practices | 2. High: global, merging, extensible, synthetic, redirecting to detailed references | - Very wide</br>- Could be redundant with other references | None for now | - **(M) Add a reference to [ISO/IEC 27090]**</br>- **(M) Add more appropriate references for safety**</br>- (C) Determine the most effective way to converge (e.g. thru ISO/JTC1/SC27 or MITRE) |
| Reference documents | 2. High: centralized, focused on standards | None identified | - **(M) Add a section on the cartography (landscape/architecture)**</br>- **(M) Choose and add safety reference(s)**</br>- (S) Add a section to explain the rules for positionning new references in the cartography</br>- (C) Shortly show the main added values and limits of each reference | None for now | 
| Presentation | 2. High: simply showing the problematics and the project | - Controversial | - **(M) Add an annex on the cartography** | None for now |
| Usecases and functionalities | 3. Low: illustrating | - Controversial</br>- Difficult to use and maintain | - (S) Clarify the use of this document in its scope | - (W) Try to make [ISO/IEC 24030] available for free |
| Trust criteria | 3. Low: structuring, aligning | - No worldwide consensus neither on the label (objectives, principles, criteria, sections, etc.) nor on the list | None for now | - (S) Contribute to [ISO/IEC 42001] when revised |
