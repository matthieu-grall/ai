# Methodological tools for artificial intelligence (AI)

This project aims to **provide methodological tools for managing AI-related risks**.


It comprises a set of documents, developed collaboratively and under continuous improvement, designed to help organizations manage AI-related risks:

1. examples of micro-usecases ;

2. harmonized trust criteria;

3. harmonized best practices;

4. a risk management method.


It is intended to fit in with existing approaches within organizations, notably system certification processes. However, some or all of these documents may also be used directly, together or separately.
