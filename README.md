# Methodological tools for artificial intelligence (AI)

This project aims to **provide methodological tools for managing AI-related risks**.


It comprises a set of documents, developed collaboratively and under continuous improvement:
1. [examples of micro-usecases](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20Micro-cas%20d'usages%20-%20Exemples.md);
2. [harmonized trust criteria](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20Crit%C3%A8res%20de%20confiance.md);
3. [harmonized best practices](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20Bonnes%20pratiques.md);
4. [a risk management method](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20M%C3%A9thode.md).

It is **intended to fit in with existing approaches within organizations**, notably system certification processes. However, some or all of these documents may also be used directly, together or separately.

The **strategic plan (and backlog)** is currently the following:
| <center>**Priority**</center> | <center>**Documents**</center> | <center>**Main added value**</center> | <center>**Main limits**</center> | <center>**Main actions on documents**</center> | <center>**Main actions on references**</center> | <center>**Main actions in organizations**</center> | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| - | General | Maybe the only global approach (needed by organizations) | Institutions not legitimate on global scope</br>Currently only in French | Validate the general value</br>Promote the approach (e.g. LINKEDIN, CESIN, Club EBIOS)</br>Translate into English | None | Test the approach | 
| 1 | Method | 1. Huge | Qualification not mature enough | Consolidate qualification</br>Develop the context establisment (description of the AI scope)</br>Add redirection to other reference documents (e.g. attacks proposed by Hub France IA) | Improve ISO and EU projects and standards | Test the method | 
| 2 | Trust criteria | 2. High | No worldwide consensus | Validate | Propose convergence (e.g. in [ISO/IEC 42001]) | None | 
| 3 | Best practices | 2. High | Very wide and complicated | Add "tags" for satisfaction criteria/proof</br>Add "tags" to state who has to implement/answer</br>Refine practices that contained in reference documents OR only redirect to them</br>Add redirection to other reference documents (e.g. controls proposed by Hub France IA) | Determine the most effective way to converge (e.g. thru MITRE) | Test the statement of applicability | 
| 4 | Micro-usecases | 3. Low | Controversial</br>Difficult to use and maintain | Organize usecases</br>Apply qualification (first step of the method) to each usecase</br>Check if [ISO/IEC 24030] can bring added value | Contribute to [ISO/IEC 24030] | Test |
