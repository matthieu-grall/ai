# Methodological tools for artificial intelligence (AI)

This project aims to **provide methodological tools for managing AI-related risks**.

A presentation is provided in [.pdf](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20Pr%C3%A9sentation.pdf) and [.pptx](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20Pr%C3%A9sentation.pptx) formats.

It **comprises a set of documents**, developed collaboratively and under continuous improvement:
1. [a risk management method](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20M%C3%A9thode.md);
2. [harmonized trust criteria](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20Crit%C3%A8res%20de%20confiance.md);
3. [harmonized best practices](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20Bonnes%20pratiques.md);
4. [examples of usecases](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20Cas%20d'usages.md);
5. [reference documents](https://github.com/matthieu-grall/ai/blob/main/IA%20-%20Gestion%20des%20risques%20-%20Documents%20de%20r%C3%A9f%C3%A9rence.md).

It is **intended to fit in with existing approaches within organizations**, notably system certification processes. However, some or all of these documents may also be used directly, together or separately.

The **strategic plan (and synthetic backlog)** is currently the following (using MoSCoW priorization: (M) Must have | (S) Should have | (C) Could Have | (W) Won't have):
| <center>**Priority**</center> | <center>**Documents**</center> | <center>**Added value**</center> | <center>**Limits**</center> | <center>**Actions on documents**</center> | <center>**Actions on references**</center> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| - | General | Maybe the only global approach (needed by organizations) | - Institutions are not legitimate on a wide global scope</br>- [Règlement IA] scope is ambiguous and cheerfully diverted, mostly in terms of concerned AI systems (products vs. services) and types of consequences</br>- Currently only in French | - (S) Promote the problematic and approach (e.g. LINKEDIN, CESIN, Club EBIOS)</br>- (S) Translate into English | None for now |
| 1 | Method | 1. Huge | - Qualification is not mature yet | - **(M) Improve convergence to the [Règlement IA] vocabulary**</br>- (S) Develop the context establisment (description of the AI scope) | - (S) Contribute to the reference documents (e.g. [ISO/IEC 23894], [ISO/IEC 42005], EU draft on risk management, [Guide de France IA]) when created or revised |
| 2 | Best practices | 2. High | - Very wide</br>- Complicated</br>- Could be redundant with other references | - **(M) Add redirections to other reference documents (e.g. controls from [Guide France IA])**</br>- (S) Add tags to show correspondence to other references (e.g. [ISO/IEC 42001] titles)</br>- (C) Add tags for satisfaction criteria/proof</br>- (C) Add tags to state who has to implement/answer</br>- (C) Refine practices that contained in reference documents | - (C) Determine the most effective way to converge (e.g. thru MITRE) |
| 3 | Reference documents | 1. Huge | None identified | - **(M) Add a section to categorize (and visualize if possible) the references landscape with their inheritances and dependances**</br>- (S) Add a section to explain the ruels / good practices for positionning new references</br>- (C) Shortly show the main added values and limits of each reference | None for now | 
| 4 | Trust criteria | 2. High | - No worldwide consensus either on the label (objectives, principles, criteria, sections, etc.) nor on the list | None for now | - (S) Contribute to [ISO/IEC 42001] when revised |
| 5 | Usecases | 3. Low | - Controversial</br>- Difficult to use and maintain | - (C) Apply qualification (first step of the method) to each usecase | - (S) Try to make [ISO/IEC 24030] available for free</br>- (W) Contribute to [ISO/IEC 24030] when revised |
